📌 About This Project

This repo is basically my digital wish list.
Instead of keeping notes scattered across apps or browser bookmarks, I store everything here in a simple and organized way. Some items are practical, some are for my maker projects, and others are just things I find awesome.

The goal is to have:

A clean list of things I want

Quick access to product links

A long-term reference for future purchases

A fun place to drop new discoveries

🛒 How to Use

Items are listed inside the wish.html page.
Each entry includes:

A short label

A direct purchase link

Categories depending on what I’m looking for (tools, electronics, gadgets, accessories, etc.)

You can open the HTML file directly or view it online if GitHub Pages is enabled.

🔗 Links

All purchase links are embedded inside wish.html.
They may include:

Online stores (AliExpress, Amazon, etc.)

Maker tools shops

Specialty stores

Any interesting product page I want to keep
