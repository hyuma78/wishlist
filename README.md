# WishList

A personal collection of tools, gadgets, maker gear, and cool items I’d love to buy.  
This repository works as my own curated wish list, with quick access to all product links.

## 📌 About

Instead of saving random notes or bookmarks everywhere, I keep everything organized here.  
The list contains:

- Tools and workshop gear  
- Electronics and maker components  
- Useful gadgets  
- Random cool stuff I want  
- Direct purchase links for each item  

Everything can be viewed easily through the `index.html` page.

## 🛠 How It Works

The list is built using a single HTML page (`index.html`) with:

- Clean layout  
- Easy-to-click links  
- Emoji-based categories  
- Responsive design  

Updating the wishlist is as easy as editing the HTML and committing changes.

## 💡 Future Ideas

- Add product images or thumbnails  
- Auto-fetch prices from APIs  
- Dark mode  
- Convert it into a small web app

Enjoy the list and future upgrades! 🎉
